# Recreating-Paint-in-WinForm

Whit this Application I try to recreate basic features of Paint in a WinForms Application.
So I can learn more about C# coding.

Implemented Features:
- Pencil Tool
- Draw Lines
- Draw Rectangles
- Draw Ellipse
- Eraser
- Draw Triangles (but Code needs work to get the correct points)
- adjust line size for each tool

planned Features
- Save File
- Load File/ Load Image
- Clear Workspace
- Different Rectangle Shapes
- Color Picker
- Color Palette
- Copy/ Paste and Crop
- Adjust Picture Size
- Zoom in/ Out

I use free Icons from iconfinder.com to avoid problems with usage. But Images can be changed in the future when I created own Icons.

Please let me know, which Features you want to see. 
You can suggest improvements and changes as well.
Contact me, if you want to improve some Code.
